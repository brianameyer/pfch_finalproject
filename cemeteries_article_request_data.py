From 1891 to 1950, the site was used as an old soldiers' home for veterans of the Confederate States Army after the American Civil War.  The Missouri state government then took over operation of the site after the last veteran died in 1950, using it as a state park.  In 1981, a cottage, a chapel, and the Confederate cemetery were listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Confederate Chapel, Cemetery and Cottage.  The chapel was moved from its original position in 1913, but was returned in 1978.  It has a tower and a stained glass window.  The cottage is a small wooden building, and the cemetery contains 723 graves.  Within the cemetery is a monument erected by the United Daughters of the Confederacy which is modeled on the Lion of Lucerne. In addition to the cemetery and historic structures, the grounds also contain trails, picnic sites, and fishing ponds.

Acacia Park Cemetery is a public cemetery on Oheyawahi-Pilot Knob hill, in Mendota Heights, Minnesota. Established in 1925, Acacia Park consists of 75 acres (300,000 m2) of land overlooking the confluence of the Minnesota and Mississippi Rivers. Prior to acquisition by European settlers, Dakota people used the site as a sacred meeting place and burial ground.
The cemetery was founded when Twin Cities members of the Masonic order purchased 125 acres (51 ha) of land at Pilot Knob, Mendota Heights. It was originally intended for the exclusive use of Masons and their families, and the name of the cemetery derives from the acacia sprig used in Masonic burial rituals.

The cemetery was established in 1935, and was actively operated until 2002. Approximately 8,000 animals and humans are buried in the cemetery\'s 11+1⁄2 acres, which is large enough to accommodate about 24,000 pets.\nThe cemetery is named for Rosa Bonheur (1822–1899), a French painter and sculptor noted for her paintings of animals.\nThe Rosa Bonheur Memorial Park made national headlines in 1979 when it became the first pet cemetery in the world to allow humans to be buried alongside their pets. There are at least 28 humans, and perhaps as many as 100, buried at the cemetery. A tomb of unknown pets was established in 1991.In 1978 the Cemetery was inherited by land developer William Anthony Green. In 1997, the owner William Anthony Green was charged for charging owners for non delivered headstones, misdelivery and abuse of remains with Commercial and Farmers Bank of Ellicott City foreclosing.  By 2006, the cemetery was no longer accepting pet or human burials.  The grounds of the Rosa Bonheur Memorial Park are currently being maintained by local volunteers. In 2013 former Howard County Planning and Zoning director Joseph W. Rutter and Donald R. Reuwer Jr proposed redeveloping 6 acres of the cemetery for a 21acre total mixed use development of commercial buildings and residential construction, moving pet graves as needed. The properties were approved to be combined for higher density development during the comprehensive zoning process of 2013.Noted animals buried at Rosa Bonheur Memorial Park include:\nGypsy Queen. In 1925, World War I veteran Frank Heath and his horse Gypsy Queen began a journey across the United States, with the goal of visiting all 48 states. They completed the trip more than two years later, returning to their starting point in Washington, D.C. in 1927. In all, the pair covered 11,356 miles, making it the longest trail ever covered by one horse under saddle. Gypsy Queen died in 1936, and a bronze tablet was erected in her honor at the Rosa Bonheur Memorial Park in 1938. Gypsy Queen also has a burial plot at the cemetery.\nMary Ann. Mary Ann was the first elephant at the Baltimore Zoo. She was brought to Baltimore from India in 1922, and was especially popular with children. Mary Ann died in 1942 after falling over in her sleep and injuring her spine. She was buried at the cemetery after her death.\nCorporal Rex Ahlbin. Rex Ahlbin was a combat dog who served with the US Marine Corps during World War II.

Rosa Bonheur Memorial Park is a pet cemetery located in Elkridge, Maryland, USA. The cemetery was established in 1935, and was actively operated until 2002. Approximately 8,000 animals and humans are buried in the cemetery's 11+1⁄2 acres, which is large enough to accommodate about 24,000 pets.
The cemetery is named for Rosa Bonheur (1822–1899), a French painter and sculptor noted for her paintings of animals.
The Rosa Bonheur Memorial Park made national headlines in 1979 when it became the first pet cemetery in the world to allow humans to be buried alongside their pets. There are at least 28 humans, and perhaps as many as 100, buried at the cemetery. A tomb of unknown pets was established in 1991.In 1978 the Cemetery was inherited by land developer William Anthony Green. In 1997, the owner William Anthony Green was charged for charging owners for non delivered headstones, misdelivery and abuse of remains with Commercial and Farmers Bank of Ellicott City foreclosing.  By 2006, the cemetery was no longer accepting pet or human burials.  The grounds of the Rosa Bonheur Memorial Park are currently being maintained by local volunteers. In 2013 former Howard County Planning and Zoning director Joseph W. Rutter and Donald R. Reuwer Jr proposed redeveloping 6 acres of the cemetery for a 21acre total mixed use development of commercial buildings and residential construction, moving pet graves as needed. The properties were approved to be combined for higher density development during the comprehensive zoning process of 2013.Noted animals buried at Rosa Bonheur Memorial Park include:
Gypsy Queen. In 1925, World War I veteran Frank Heath and his horse Gypsy Queen began a journey across the United States, with the goal of visiting all 48 states. They completed the trip more than two years later, returning to their starting point in Washington, D.C. in 1927. In all, the pair covered 11,356 miles, making it the longest trail ever covered by one horse under saddle. Gypsy Queen died in 1936, and a bronze tablet was erected in her honor at the Rosa Bonheur Memorial Park in 1938. Gypsy Queen also has a burial plot at the cemetery.
Mary Ann. Mary Ann was the first elephant at the Baltimore Zoo. She was brought to Baltimore from India in 1922, and was especially popular with children. Mary Ann died in 1942 after falling over in her sleep and injuring her spine. She was buried at the cemetery after her death.
Corporal Rex Ahlbin. Rex Ahlbin was a combat dog who served with the US Marine Corps during World War II. Rex served with the US 3rd Marine Division during the Battle of Empress Augusta Bay at Bougainville Island in 1943. Rex, a two-year-old Doberman, warned of the presence of Japanese soldiers near a Marine position, enabling Marines to fend off a later attack. Rex also served with the Marine Corps during the Guadalcanal campaign and at the Battle of Tinian. For his service, Rex was promoted to the rank of corporal by the Marine Corps in 1944.

Little Van Atta (1947–1955), an underground courier dog born in France, who is said to have brought the news of D-Day to her native city with a message hidden in her collar.
Pretty Boy Boyer (1954–1956), a parakeet with a vocabulary of 1000 words. His headstone is inscribed "Bye, Bye, Mommy, see you later", which is what he always said when his owner left the room.
Carlo (1939–1966), a dog.  At age 27, he was, according to his burial marker, "one of the oldest authenticated dogs in the country".
Gretchen (1939–1950), a boxer who saved the lives of her owner and the owner's father by waking them up during the night when a fire broke out in their home.
Moses Gigrandy (1929–1942), a monkey.
Misty, a German Shepherd seeing-eye dog to a veteran blinded at the Battle of the Bulge in World War II.
Sylvester, a rabbit who slept on his young polio-stricken master's bed for three years and was trained to play certain games. Shortly after the boy died, Sylvester passed on and was buried at Bonheur.
Wiggles, a 29-year-old champion horse.
Lizzy, a monitor lizard born in Africa.
Amanda, a guinea pig.
Buster Ward (1967–1979), a pigeon that flew into a moving mail truck.

James Renwick, Jr., is the architect of Trinity Church Cemetery and further updates were made by Calvert Vaux. The uptown cemetery is also the center of the Heritage Rose District of New York City.
A no-longer-extant Trinity Parish burial ground was the Old Saint John's Burying Ground for St. John's Chapel. This location is bounded by Hudson, Leroy and Clarkson streets near Hudson Square. It was in use from 1806 to 1852 with over 10,000 burials, mostly poor and young. In 1897, it was turned into St. John's Park, with most of the burials left in place. The park was later renamed Hudson Park, and is now James J. Walker Park.  (This park is different from a separate St. John's Park, a former private park and residential block approximately one mile to the south that now serves as part of the Holland Tunnel access.)

He was the son of Benjamin Van Cleve and Mary Whitten Van Cleve. The cemetery began with 40 acres (160,000 m2) southeast of Dayton and has been enlarged to its present size of 200 acres (0.81 km2). Over 3,000 trees and 165 specimens of native Midwestern trees and woody plants grace the rolling hills. Many of the trees are more than a century old and 9 have been designated "Ohio Champions."  The highest point in Dayton is within the cemetery, and during the Great Dayton Flood of 1913, it became a place of refuge.\nThe Romanesque gateway, chapel and office, completed in 1889, are on the National Register of Historic Places.  The buildings were constructed of the stone from the original cemetery wall.  The chapel has one of the finest original Tiffany windows in the country.

Woodland Cemetery and Arboretum (200 acres), located at 118 Woodland Avenue, Dayton, Ohio, is one of the oldest garden cemeteries in the United States.
Woodland was incorporated in 1842 by John Whitten Van Cleve, the first male child born in Dayton. He was the son of Benjamin Van Cleve and Mary Whitten Van Cleve. The cemetery began with 40 acres (160,000 m2) southeast of Dayton and has been enlarged to its present size of 200 acres (0.81 km2). Over 3,000 trees and 165 specimens of native Midwestern trees and woody plants grace the rolling hills. Many of the trees are more than a century old and 9 have been designated "Ohio Champions."  The highest point in Dayton is within the cemetery, and during the Great Dayton Flood of 1913, it became a place of refuge.
The Romanesque gateway, chapel and office, completed in 1889, are on the National Register of Historic Places.  The buildings were constructed of the stone from the original cemetery wall.  The chapel has one of the finest original Tiffany windows in the country. A mausoleum, with a rock and bronze exterior, features twenty-two varieties of imported marble and twelve large stained glass windows inspired by famous literary works. It was added in 1970.  The oldest original 105-acre section of the cemetery, known as "Victorian," received a second designation as a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places in 2011.

The city of Greenville contributes to the maintenance of the cemetery, but there is no perpetual care fund, and the graves themselves remain private property.  A "Friends of Springwood Cemetery" organization was formed in 2002 to raise awareness of cemetery needs.

None of the gravesites is fenced off, and there are no circulating paths or roadways on the grounds.The cemetery, along with the nearby Ireland Street Cemetery, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009.

It was established to serve the residents of the Pondville village, which was first settled in the 1730s.  The cemetery is laid out on a series of terraces that rise from Everett Street to the west, with the oldest graves in the southwest corner, near the Wrentham line.  The oldest stones date to the early 19th century, and one of the most prominent markers is the c.1877 Victorian memorial to Captain Abijah Pond, an American Revolutionary War veteran.The cemetery was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014.

The soldiers' remains were moved to the Philadelphia National Cemetery in 1891.
By the 1920s, Glenwood Cemetery had fallen into disrepair, suffered from vandalism and was the target for new development. The City of Philadelphia closed the cemetery to new burials in 1921 and many families relocated graves including the famous Barrymore family of actors. New Glenwood Cemetery was established in 1923 on farm land in Broomall.  The remains of 169 Mexican-American War veterans were reinterred to the Philadelphia National Cemetery in 1927 and the 20-foot marble monument to their honor was moved with them.
Old Glenwood Cemetery was closed by the City of Philadelphia in 1938 and 20,000 burials were relocated to New Glenwood Cemetery. The cemetery expanded after World War II and was renamed Glenwood Memorial Gardens. It is currently owned by Service Corporation International, the largest cemetery provider in the United States.

The Presbyterian Burying Ground, also known as the Old Presbyterian Burying Ground, was a historic cemetery which existed between 1802 and 1909 in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, D.C., in the United States. It was one of the most prominent cemeteries in the city until the 1860s. Burials there tapered significantly after Oak Hill Cemetery was founded nearby in 1848. The Presbyterian Burying Ground closed to new burials in 1887, and about 500 to 700 bodies were disinterred after 1891 when an attempt was made to demolish the cemetery and use the land for housing. The remaining graves fell into extensive disrepair. After a decade of effort, the District of Columbia purchased the cemetery in 1909 and built Volta Park there, leaving nearly 2,000 bodies buried at the site.

As time went on, the cemetery has suffered from considerable neglect and illegal dumping activity.In 2020, a research team based out of The University of Texas at Austin conducted research on the site investigating the linkage of the cemetery to pandemic-related deaths of the twentieth century.The cemetery is composed of two sections: the first and original section, San Jose I, is located at 705 Montopolis Drive, and the second later addition, San Jose II, is located at 8101 Posten Lane off of Hoeke Lane.

After a cycle of neglect and restoration in the 1970s and 1980s, the cemetery was thereafter maintained by the municipality of College City until College City's 2017 consolidation with Walnut Ridge.The cemetery was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2021.

It was built in 1789 and is a relatively large, two story, two bay shingled building with a broad, overhanging gable roof. It is the oldest Methodist church in New York State in continuous operation.  The surrounding burial ground has graves dating to the 18th century.Methodism in Winne-Comac began in 1783 when a society was formed after a sermon preached by John Phillips, a Methodist local preacher and a tailor in the British army during the Revolutionary War. James Hubbs had heard him in Cow Harbor (now Northport) and invited him to preach in his home. The first conference preacher, Phillip Cox, was appointed to Newton and Comac the following year, holding services in homes, with a total of two dozen members, half of them Negro slaves. In 1785 Ezekiel Cooper was appointed to the Long Island Circuit of which Comac was a part.\nThe Comac Society was the second to be formed on Long Island, preceded only by Newton in 1768. However, the historic building we now call our 1789 Chapel, has the distinction of being the oldest Methodist Church in continuous use in New York in which people still worship in the original building, with but few alterations. For it was in 1789 during the pastorate of William Phoebus that James Hubbs and the community erected "a neat, substantial and commodious house of worship." Others active in the society at that time were Nehemiah Brush, Jacob Wheeler, Charles Peters, Joel Rogers and Jacob Hoff. The land was purchased from Von Hadah Robbins for two pounds five shillings. Featured were a high box pulpit, one center door, and one balcony stairs. Foot warmers were brought by worshippers in the cold winters.\nIn 1791 Harry Hosier, known as Black Harry, preached at the invitation of Jacob Brush, while traveling with Bishop Francis Asbury; and in 1796, Freeborn Garretson was Presiding Elder. In 1803, a group from Winne-Comac with Freeborn Garretson, established a class at the home of Joseph Higby, Little Harbor, later called Centerport, while Sylvester was pastor.\nIn 1806, Mitchell B. Bull and James Cleman, joint preachers of the Long Island Circuit, each preached only 15 times at Comac because of the size of their circuit. In 1810, Comac became part of the Suffolk County Circuit along with Happauge and Sag Harbor, with joint preachers Henry Redstone and Coles Carpenter.\nA hand written summary of early Quarterly Conferences (1/4", with writer\'s shorthand) with only the name "Chris Hawkes, 1895" located in the Huntington Historical Society Library, provided interesting sidelights of an 1815 meeting: "On Sunday a.m. services started at 8 or 9 o’clock with a Love Feast. On these important occasions the membership of all the surrounding country came together, and we were given tickets of admission to the communion services by the class leaders. No one could enter these sacred services otherwise, nor those who wore rings on fingers or ears, nor flowers or hats." The circuit riders traveled some 250 miles each month to cover their circuit. Until 1869, a different preacher was assigned to Comac each year, including 1833 when the Smithtown circuit was formed and J. Lovejoy was the assigned preacher. In 1830 services were held every two weeks in Comac.\nIn 1835-36, the building was remodeled during the tenure of John B. Merwin. The roof was shingled; a chimney was built for a stove with accompanying monstrous pipes across the building; the twelve foot high pulpit was remodeled and lowered two feet; the communion rail was made semicircular; the floor was raised where needed to make it level; and two panel entrance doors were built replacing the single one, with two flights of stairs to the balcony. Men entered and sat on the left side, women on the right.\nIn 1859 the pulpit was again lowered during some remodeling while Eben S. Hibbard was pastor. A letter from W.A. Layton, pastor 1880-82 to Mrs. M. E. Shea, dated May 1, 1934, stated that during his pastorate the church still had the high pulpit, and he remembered performing the wedding ceremony for Mr. & Mrs. Fred Goldsmith, Senior, while Rev. Wardell was District Superintendent. He further stated that he "never spent a happier pastorate than the one he spent on the Smithtown Circuit."\nIn 1883 the pulpit was lowered to its present height for the 100th anniversary of the society. In 1889, a parsonage was built as part of the celebration of the 100th anniversary, during pastorate of William Dalziel, and a barn and sheds were built in 1895.\n"Let there be light!" Between 1921-23, electricity was wired into the church. There was none in Comac until after 1918, since Brindley Field in Comac was responsible for bringing it for its own use during World War I, and it became available to homes, stores, and the Church.\nAlso in 1923 new song books were purchased, and a gold lettered church sign was erected. In 1925 or 1926, the basement was dug out for the first time to install a furnace for comfortable warmth, and finally to get rid of the monstrous pipes overhead.\nIn 1939, in preparation for the 150th anniversary, the building was painted, landscaping of church grounds was improved, a circular driveway with Belgian blocks and a border were made, continuing along the sidewalk as a WPA project. The sign "Commack Methodist Church. The oldest Methodist Church edifice..." was erected and the World War I Honor Roll sign moved closer to the street on west side of building and a field was cleaned for parking area. Bishop Francis J. Mc Connel preached at the Sunday, October 1 evening service, with 125 attending, 54 guests registered, and an offering of $21.50.\nTuesday night was "Old Pastor’s Night," with greetings by many former pastors and a brief historical sketch by Rev. William C. Craig, with 120 attending, and an offering of $24.25.\nThursday night was "Interdenominational Night," with greetings from many churches; hymn singing led by Dr. Richard L. Francis; and a history of the church given by Mrs. E. Shea, mother of Henry Shea; and greetings from Rev. J. Percival Huget, president of Suffolk County Council of Churches. The attendance was 230, and the offering, $30.50.\nThe Old Home Jubilee Meeting was held Sunday, October 8 at 3 p.m.. with song service again led by Dr. Francis. A group photo taken in front of the building included some 125 of the 185 present. The address was given by Albert E. Beebe, superintendent of the Brooklyn North District. Attendance was 185 and offering, $34.25. Charles S. Gray was Pastor.\nIn 1952 remodeling included a new roof, new foundation, heating system, and some replacement floor beams, during the pastorate of R.R. Roberts, who also wrote a history of Methodism in Commack.\nIn 1957 because of increasing attendance, the first section of the Religious Education Building was completed at a cost of $60,000, and rented for three years for weekday use to the Commack Public Schools. In 1961, at a time of burgeoning population growth in Commack, a second unit was added at a cost of $70,000, and used by Suffolk County BOCES until 1973. During this period, Sunday School enrollment was over 200. Austin Armitstead was pastor in 1957, and Max Mobley in 1961. The appearance of the altar area was enhanced by additions of a reredos similar to that of historic St. George Church in Philadelphia.\nIn 1964 the 175th anniversary of the building was celebrated with a series of special Sunday services from September 20 - October 11, with guest speakers Rev. Harrison Davis, District Superintendent; Bishop Lloyd C. Wicke; Bishop Frederick B. Newell; Dr. Ross Linger, former pastor; and Dr. Henry Whyman, Executive Secretary of the New York Society. A gala dinner was held at the Huntington Town House. Mortgage was paid on the Religious Education building, and a vote was taken to purchase land for a new Sanctuary and Fellowship Hall.\nThe new sanctuary was dedicated in 1968, and the older building became known as the "1789 Chapel." It is still used for worship on the Sunday before July 4, and for Christmas Eve services, as well as by the Long Island Korean United Methodist Church which has been sharing our facilities since 1979.\nIn 1983 a 200th anniversary celebration of the Society included making a bicentennial banner and quilt; an open house tour of the historical home of Senator Burr; printing of a cookbook of members’ recipes; a pictorial directory; a slide lecture of Commack by Brad Harris, Smithtown Historian; a worship service May 1, 1983 with sermon by Bishop Roy C. Nichols, and a Homecoming Service September 18 with reminiscences from former pastors and members.\nThe 1789 Chapel continues to be a vital part of the total church program in spreading the gospel of Christ to the people of Commack.\nA cemetery with graves dating from 1791 is adjacent to the Chapel.\nIt was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.\n\n'}}}}

"Let there be light!" Between 1921-23, electricity was wired into the church. There was none in Comac until after 1918, since Brindley Field in Comac was responsible for bringing it for its own use during World War I, and it became available to homes, stores, and the Church.
Also in 1923 new song books were purchased, and a gold lettered church sign was erected. In 1925 or 1926, the basement was dug out for the first time to install a furnace for comfortable warmth, and finally to get rid of the monstrous pipes overhead.
In 1939, in preparation for the 150th anniversary, the building was painted, landscaping of church grounds was improved, a circular driveway with Belgian blocks and a border were made, continuing along the sidewalk as a WPA project. The sign "Commack Methodist Church. The oldest Methodist Church edifice..." was erected and the World War I Honor Roll sign moved closer to the street on west side of building and a field was cleaned for parking area. Bishop Francis J. Mc Connel preached at the Sunday, October 1 evening service, with 125 attending, 54 guests registered, and an offering of $21.50.
Tuesday night was "Old Pastor’s Night," with greetings by many former pastors and a brief historical sketch by Rev. William C. Craig, with 120 attending, and an offering of $24.25.
Thursday night was "Interdenominational Night," with greetings from many churches; hymn singing led by Dr. Richard L. Francis; and a history of the church given by Mrs. E. Shea, mother of Henry Shea; and greetings from Rev. J. Percival Huget, president of Suffolk County Council of Churches. The attendance was 230, and the offering, $30.50.
The Old Home Jubilee Meeting was held Sunday, October 8 at 3 p.m.. with song service again led by Dr. Francis. A group photo taken in front of the building included some 125 of the 185 present. The address was given by Albert E. Beebe, superintendent of the Brooklyn North District. Attendance was 185 and offering, $34.25. Charles S. Gray was Pastor.
In 1952 remodeling included a new roof, new foundation, heating system, and some replacement floor beams, during the pastorate of R.R. Roberts, who also wrote a history of Methodism in Commack.
In 1957 because of increasing attendance, the first section of the Religious Education Building was completed at a cost of $60,000, and rented for three years for weekday use to the Commack Public Schools. In 1961, at a time of burgeoning population growth in Commack, a second unit was added at a cost of $70,000, and used by Suffolk County BOCES until 1973. During this period, Sunday School enrollment was over 200. Austin Armitstead was pastor in 1957, and Max Mobley in 1961. The appearance of the altar area was enhanced by additions of a reredos similar to that of historic St. George Church in Philadelphia.
In 1964 the 175th anniversary of the building was celebrated with a series of special Sunday services from September 20 - October 11, with guest speakers Rev. Harrison Davis, District Superintendent; Bishop Lloyd C. Wicke; Bishop Frederick B. Newell; Dr. Ross Linger, former pastor; and Dr. Henry Whyman, Executive Secretary of the New York Society. A gala dinner was held at the Huntington Town House. Mortgage was paid on the Religious Education building, and a vote was taken to purchase land for a new Sanctuary and Fellowship Hall.
The new sanctuary was dedicated in 1968, and the older building became known as the "1789 Chapel." It is still used for worship on the Sunday before July 4, and for Christmas Eve services, as well as by the Long Island Korean United Methodist Church which has been sharing our facilities since 1979.
In 1983 a 200th anniversary celebration of the Society included making a bicentennial banner and quilt; an open house tour of the historical home of Senator Burr; printing of a cookbook of members’ recipes; a pictorial directory; a slide lecture of Commack by Brad Harris, Smithtown Historian; a worship service May 1, 1983 with sermon by Bishop Roy C. Nichols, and a Homecoming Service September 18 with reminiscences from former pastors and members.
The 1789 Chapel continues to be a vital part of the total church program in spreading the gospel of Christ to the people of Commack.
A cemetery with graves dating from 1791 is adjacent to the Chapel.
It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.

The Old City Cemetery, also known as Linwood Cemetery, is a 28.7-acre (11.6 ha) cemetery on what is now Linwood Boulevard, in Columbus, Georgia.  It dates from 1828, when the town of Columbus was founded, or before.  It appears in surveyor Edward Lloyd Thomas's original plan for the city.  The cemetery consists mostly of rectangular family plots bordered by iron fences or walls made of brick or granite, accessed by a main east-west corridor and perpendicular lanes.  It includes both simple and elaborate tombstones, some displaying Egyptian Revival or Gothic styles.
